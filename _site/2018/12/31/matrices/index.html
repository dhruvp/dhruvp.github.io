  <h2 id="matrices-and-their-intuition">Matrices and their Intuition</h2>

<p>Many of us have probably encountered matrices at some point but in math class. They’re this little awkward tables with seemingly byzantine rules for multiplying and inverting them. We all probably learned how to operate on them at some point but how did someone come up with them? Where do these rules for multiplication and inversion even come from? In short, what’s the underlying intuition for matrices?</p>

<p>I really think it’s worth answering this question because we use matrices in almost every field of engineering but often times don’t appreciate what they mean. To me it’s not too different from applying multiplication tables without fully appreciating what numbers are.</p>

<p>So let’s try and rectify that a litte. Through this post, I’m going to share my intuition of matrices and why they represent such a powerful idea. We’re going to do so by starting with the idea of linear functions and then using that knowledge to derive matrices.</p>

<h2 id="linear-functions">Linear functions</h2>

<p>Linear functions are the foundations of matrices. Before diving into what they are, let’s start really simply by focusing on one specific example and moving up from there.</p>

<p>Let’s take the function that reflects lines about the y axis.</p>

<p>[INSERT DIAGRAM HERE]</p>

<p>What are some interesting things to note about this function?</p>
<ol>
  <li>I can multiply by a number before or after applying the function and I’ll get the same result.
Show example</li>
  <li>I can add before or after applying the function and I’ll get the same result.
Show example</li>
</ol>

<p>In fact, there are a lot of functions that obey these rules. Here are a few more:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rotations</li>
  <li>Scaling</li>
</ul>

<p>Early mathematicians realized that such functions can model a lot of the phenomena that happen in the real world from physics, to statistics. We call these functions linear functions (not to be confused with a linear equation) and their main rules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>f(c•x) = c•f(x)
    <ul>
      <li>Can multiply before or after applying the function and get the same result.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)
    <ul>
      <li>Can add before or after applying the function and get the same result.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="geometric-interpretation-of-linear-functions">Geometric Interpretation of Linear Functions</h2>
<p>What do these linear functions look like? Here are a few videos from Khan Academy visualizing their effect on a 1d and 2d space:

<h2 id="representing-linear-functions">Representing Linear Functions</h2>
<p>Let’s try and come up with a way to represent these functions. Taking a step back, how do we represent functions in general? One way is to simply have a table that takes every input and displays its output. For instance, we could write:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>x</th>
      <th>f(x)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>But this can much more easily be written as <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> f(x) = \frac{1}{2} </annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.845108em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:1.190108em;vertical-align:-0.345em;"></span><span class="base"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathit">x</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mord rule" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mord rule" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mopen nulldelimiter"></span><span class="mfrac"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.845108em;"><span style="top:-2.6550000000000002em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span><span style="top:-3.15em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="stretchy" style="height:0.2em;"><svg width="400em" height="0.2em" viewBox="0 0 400000 200" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin slice"><path d="M0 80H400000 v40H0z M0 80H400000 v40H0z"></path></svg></span></span><span style="top:-3.394em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.345em;"></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose nulldelimiter"></span></span></span></span></span>. This representation, a polynomial, is powerful. If someone asks me, “what happens if I apply f, followed by g (g(x) = 10x)”, I can use this representation to realize that g(f(x)) = 10(2(x)) = 20x.</p>

<p>I feel like you jumped ^ a tiny bit here. It’s not a difficult mathematical function but I’m a very visual learner so it would’ve helped if you laid out in a column step by step fashion how you put f(x) into g(x). It’s not a hard thing but I had to reread your “what happens if I apply f followed by g” sentence a few times before I got what was going on.</p>

<p>Imagine trying to make a new table each time. The key here is that representations give us power.</p>

<p>All linear transforms on the real numbers in 1 dimension can be written simply as y = mx. So the representation in one dimension is easy.</p>

<p>But what about in 2 dimensions or more?</p>

<p>Maybe a diagram will help, but what do you mean by “dimension” here?</p>

<p>Clearly we can’t just do y = mx anymore (can’t represent rotations like this etc.). So let’s try and do something slightly different.</p>

<p>Let’s just start by describing what the function does to two of the most basic points (1,0) and (0,1).</p>

<p>Show f(x) equation again otherwise I have to scroll up to remember it?</p>

<p>f(1, 0) = (3, 0)
f(0, 1) = (0, 5)</p>

<p>Based on this, can I figure out f(10, 9) is? Amazingly, yes! Because this is a linear function, we see that f(10, 9) = f(10, 0) + f(0, 9) = 10•f(1,0) + 9•f(0,1) = (30, 0) + (0, 45) = (30, 45).</p>

<p>Another slight jump here. Where and when and why is g(x) brought in?</p>

<p>What this shows is that we can represent the function entirely by what it does to the points (0,1) and (1,0).</p>

<p>I would put this sentence before your actual multiplication above ^ and then draw visual diagrams from f(10,9) to the (1,0) and (0,1) former and latter 1’s specifically. As a visual learner the diagram would help connect the dots much faster.
Matrices
A simple 2x2 matrix does just this - it describes what a function does on the points (0, 1) and (1,0).
f(x) can be represented by
[f(1, 0) f(0,1)]
=
[3   0]
[0   5]</p>

<p>This is extremely cool - we can describe the entire function and how it operates on an infinite number of points by a little 4 value table.</p>

<p>Beautiful. I love this explanation!!!!!</p>

<p>So just like whenever you see f(x) = 2x + 3, you immediately know you’re dealing with a function, next time you see a matrix, know that you are dealing with a shorthand for a linear function. It’s the f(x) = mx of the linear world.
Understanding Matrix Multiplication
Ok so we know know that a matrix represents a function - so how do we apply this function on an input? Let’s see this step by step:</p>

<p>Say I have the same function f which we described by the matrix [[3 0][0 5]]. I want to apply this function on the vector [[x][y]]. How do we do it?</p>

<p>Let’s start with what we know. We know what f([1][0]) and f([[0][1]]) are.</p>

<p>Wait, do we know what f([[0][1]]) is? Jumped a bit here. Oh wait maybe I need the matrix diagram here lol. I think I’ll wait to see that diagram and it’ll help visualize better.
Can we break [[x][y]] into a combination of [1 0] and [0 1]?
[[x][y]] = x•[[1][0]] + y•[[0][1]]
Can we now use our knowledge of f([1][0]) and f([0][1])?
f([[x][y]]) = f(x•[[1][0]] + y•[[0][1]])
Thanks to the amazing properties of linear functions, we can now simplify this to:
= f(x•[[1][0]]) + f(y•[[0][1]])
Because f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b)
= x•f([[1][0]) + y•f([[0][1])
Because f(c•a) = c•f(a)
And now we apply the knowledge we have!
= x•[[3][0]] + y•[[0][5]]
= [[3x + 0y][0x + 5y]]
Now this is a pain to write out everytime. Can we create a simple rule on how to get this final result?
Let’s say we have an arbitrary function F represented by the matrix [[a b][c d]]
We want to apply F on [x y].
If we follow the same steps as above, we get
f([x][y]) = x•[[a][c]] + y•[[b][d]] = [[ax + by][cx + dy]]
Look familiar? This is the exact rule for matrix multiplication!
I hope you’ve now seen that matrix multiplication rules are just a shorthand for applying a function on a vector. Remember, none of this would work unless the function were a linear function! Only because it was linear could we use our knowledge of f[0][1] and f[1][0] to get the result of f([x][y]).</p>

<p>Ok so we’ve seen that multiplying a 2x2 matrix by a vector is just applying the function on the vector. But what does matrix multiplication when we are multiplying two 2x2 matrices? What’s going on there?</p>

<p>To answer this, we’re going to take a small detour. We know how to apply a function f on an input vector v. What if I ask you to apply g(f(v)) where we know f and g?</p>

<p>Let’s work through this now:</p>

<p>Let G = [[5 9][1 6]]. Let F = [[3 0][0 5]] as before.
We want H = G • F. The matrix for this is going to be:</p>

<p>H = [g(f([1][0]) g(f([0][1])]
    = [g([3][0]) g([0][5])]</p>

<p>So what’s g([3][0])? Well we just saw earlier that we just multiply G by [[3][0]] to get that answer.
So the first column is just G•[[3][0]]. Similarly, the next column is just G•[[0][5]]
H = [G•[[3][0]]  G•[[0][5]]]</p>

<p>Seem familiar? Because it’s exactly what happens in 2x2 matrix multiplication! What this is showing us is that matrix multiplication can be thought of as function composition. Thanks to matrix multiplication, we have amazingly simple rules for understanding f•g, f+g etc. without manually writing out a bunch of tables.
Combining Functions
Remember how much power we gained by being able to represent a function as a polynomial? We were able to combine polynomials, compose them, multiply them - we now have all that same power for linear functions! We can compose them (matrix multiplication), add them (matrix addition), and invert them (matrix inversion) all by following some simple rules. A more sophisticated way of saying this is we have an algebra on these functions (just like we have an algebra on integers etc.). This is what linear algebra means - the ability to do combine and compose linear functions just as we combine and compose integers.</p>

<p>Imagine doing all this with input-output tables! It would be hell. Instead, we can now operate on these complex functions and combine them in all kinds of ways and immediately know the resulting function.
Conclusion
So we’ve seen pretty clearly that matrices are just functions and that linear algebra is the study of combining linear functions.</p>

<p>Understanding this helps us perceive some of the key ideas of linear algebra in a new way. In the next post, we’re going to focus on eigenvectors and learn why they are so useful in playing with these functions.</p>
