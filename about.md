  Hi! I'm Dhruv Parthasarathy and I'm currently a developer at [Udacity](www.udacity.com). I'm passionate about using technology and education to provide people the opportunity to live the life they wish to lead. I graduated from MIT with double major in Math and CS in 2013. In my spare time I love playing basketball and learning new things on Functional Programming.

Thanks for reading!
